Description:

Friends have reported Elizabeth missing and need your help locating her! Can you follow the clues in the missing person flyer and find her most recent location? 

Solution:

Decoding the numbers from the pdf from decimal to ascii gives
`Hey! I'm hosting a retreat for my clients so I'll be off the grid for awhile - I got a new phone number, so call me if you need anything (979)429-2176.` Calling the number gives an automated message that tells you the URL of a website, https://eowensphotography.weebly.com/ and there you find the flag `TAMUctf{3_0W3N5}`
