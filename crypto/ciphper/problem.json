  "description": "Background story: this code was once used on a REAL site to encrypt REAL data. Thankfully, this code is no longer being used and has not for a long time.\n\nA long time ago, one of the sites I was building needed to store some some potentially sensitive data. I did not know how to use any proper encryption techniques, so I wrote my own symmetric {{url_for(\"crypto.php\", display=\"cipher\")}}.\n\nThe encrypted content in {{url_for(\"output.bin\")}} is a well-known, olde English quote in lowercase ASCII alphabetic characters. No punctuation; just letters and spaces.\n\nThe flag is key to understanding this message.",
